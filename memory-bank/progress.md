# Progress

## Done

- Read source planning documents:
  - `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`
  - `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
  - `SCREEN_FLOW.md`
  - `UI_UX_REQUIREMENTS.md`
  - `ROADMAP.md`
  - `AUTOMATION_PHASE.md`
  - `AI_PHASE.md`
- Created project instructions in `AGENTS.md`.
- Created memory bank.
- VPS folder `/opt/shoponline` was prepared earlier.
- Git remote configured on VPS.
- Reserved ports checked and available.

## In Progress

- Project planning and implementation context preparation.

## Not Started

- Actual application scaffold.
- Database migrations.
- Auth/RBAC implementation.
- Public storefront.
- Admin dashboard.
- CRUD modules.
- Reports.
- Automation.
- AI features.

## Risks

- GitHub push from VPS requires credentials.
- Scope is broad; implementation must follow roadmap order to avoid unstable demo.
- Dashboard/report accuracy depends on correct inventory/order/finance rules.
- Automation and AI should wait until enough reliable operational data exists.

## 2026-05-27 Smoke Data Cleanup

- Added `scripts/cleanup-smoke-data.ts`.
- Added `npm run smoke:cleanup`.
- Cleanup defaults to dry-run and requires `CONFIRM_SMOKE_CLEANUP=yes` for destructive changes.
- Cleanup removes known smoke/UAT orders, payments, shipments, purchases, inventory rows, products, categories, customers, suppliers, debts, expenses, promotions, notifications, timelines, and activity logs.
- Smoke test users are archived instead of deleted to avoid user-related historical constraints.
- Backed up Postgres before the first production cleanup.
- Removed accumulated smoke data from repeated VPS regression runs.
- Verified `npm run check` still passes after adding cleanup tooling.
- Ran cleanup again after regression so the production DB dry-run returns zero matched smoke records.

## 2026-05-27 CI Actions Runtime Update

- GitHub Actions reported the upcoming Node.js 20 actions runtime deprecation.
- Checked current action releases through GitHub API.
- Updated CI to `actions/checkout@v6` and `actions/setup-node@v6`.
- Kept the project runtime check on Node 22 via `actions/setup-node`.


## 2026-05-27 VPS Auth Foundation

- Added admin login/logout.
- Added signed session cookie.
- Protected admin routes with middleware.
- Dashboard now requires current user and reads DB metrics dynamically.
- Rebuilt and redeployed `shoponline-web`.
- Browser auth smoke passed on VPS.

## 2026-05-28 Admin Username Login

- Changed `/admin/login` to show `Tên đăng nhập` instead of email.
- Default admin login is now `admin` / `123456`.
- Kept the existing internal admin email `admin@shoponline.local` and mapped username `admin` to it in the login action to avoid a schema migration and preserve existing scripts.
- Updated seed defaults so future seed runs recreate the same admin credential.
- Updated the live VPS admin user password hash and status.
- Verified `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `docker compose up -d --build web`, `npm run smoke:prod`, and `npm run smoke:admin-auth`.

## 2026-05-28 Site Login Lock

- Updated `apps/web/src/proxy.ts` so public routes now require the existing session cookie.
- Unauthenticated requests to `/`, `/products`, `/cart`, `/checkout`, `/tracking`, and admin pages redirect to `/admin/login` with a `next` query.
- Left `/admin/login`, `/admin/logout`, `/api/health`, Next.js static assets, and public files accessible so login, logout, and container healthchecks continue to work.
- Rebuilt and redeployed `shoponline-web`.
- Verified:
  - `npm run lint` passed.
  - `npm run build` passed.
  - `npm run smoke:prod` passed with public routes returning HTTP 307.
  - `https://cargo.io.vn/` returns HTTP 307 to `/admin/login?next=%2F`.

## 2026-05-28 Admin Navigation Login Loop Fix

- Login form now carries the `next` query through a hidden field.
- Login action redirects to a validated `next` path after successful login instead of always redirecting to `/admin/dashboard`.
- Removed the `Về website` link from the login screen because the public site is now locked and the link created a confusing loop.
- Adjusted proxy to allow `/api/admin/*` route handlers through; those handlers still enforce auth/RBAC themselves and need access to form `sessionToken`.
- Verified:
  - `npm run lint` passed.
  - `npm run build` passed.
  - Docker web redeploy passed.
  - `npm run smoke:prod` passed.
  - `npm run smoke:admin-auth` passed.
  - Authenticated requests to `/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/products`, `/admin/orders`, and `/admin/settings` returned HTTP 200.

## 2026-05-28 Root Login Target Fix

- Fixed the root-login loop where visiting `cargo.io.vn/` produced `next=/` and login returned to the public home page.
- Proxy now maps unauthenticated `/` to `/admin/login?next=/admin/dashboard`.
- Proxy now maps authenticated `/` directly to `/admin/dashboard`.
- Login uses a normal POST form to `/admin/login/submit`; the route sets `shoponline.session` and redirects using `Host` / `X-Forwarded-Proto` so it stays on `https://cargo.io.vn`.
- Tightened `/api/admin/settings` auth so inactive users supplied through `sessionToken` are rejected.
- Verified on `https://cargo.io.vn`:
  - No cookie on `/` returns `307 /admin/login?next=%2Fadmin%2Fdashboard`.
  - POST login returns `303 Location: https://cargo.io.vn/admin/dashboard`.
  - With cookie, `/` returns `307 /admin/dashboard`.
  - `/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/products`, `/admin/orders`, and `/admin/settings` return HTTP 200.

- Verified dashboard HTML renders sidebar items as normal anchors for `/admin/products`, `/admin/orders`, and `/admin/settings`.
- Verified `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, Docker web redeploy, `npm run smoke:prod`, `npm run smoke:admin-auth`, and `npm run smoke:admin-ui`.

No destructive cleanup was run.

- Extended `scripts/smoke-admin-exports.ts` to call every CSV export endpoint without a session cookie and assert HTTP 401 with no `text/csv` response.

  - `npm run prisma:migrate` applied all 13 migrations.

  - Temporary test container was removed.
